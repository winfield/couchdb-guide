## 序言 ##

### Damien Katz, CouchDB创始人 ###

作为CouchDB的创始人, 写这篇序对我来说是一个极大的乐趣. This book has been a long time coming. 我从2005起就开始编写CouchDB了, 那时候它在我的脑子里只是一个vision, 只有我的妻子Laura相信我一定可以完成它. 

现在, 这个项目已经有了自己的生命, 并且已经被运行在数百万台机器上了. I couldn't stop it now if I tried.

A great analogy J. Chris uses is that CouchDB has felt like a boulder we’ve been pushing up a hill. Over time, it’s been moving faster and getting easier to push, and now it’s moving so fast it’s starting to feel like it could get loose and crush some unlucky villagers. Or something. Hey, remember “Tales of the Runaway Boulder” with Robert Wagner on Saturday Night Live? Good times.

Well, now we are trying to safely guide that boulder. Because of the villagers. You know what? This boulder analogy just isn’t working. Let’s move on.

The reason for this book is that CouchDB is a very different way of approaching data storage. A way that isn’t inherently better or worse than the ways before—it’s just another tool, another way of thinking about things. It’s missing some features you might be used to, but it’s gained some abilities you’ve maybe never seen. Sometimes it’s an excellent fit for your problems; sometimes it’s terrible.

And sometimes you may be thinking about your problems all wrong. You just need to approach them from a different angle.

Hopefully this book will help you understand CouchDB and the approach that it takes, and also understand how and when it can be used for the problems you face.

Otherwise, someday it could become a runaway boulder, being misused and causing disasters that could have been avoided.

And I’ll be doing my best Charlton Heston imitation, on the ground, pounding the dirt, yelling, “You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!” Or something like that.
